# Recursion #

**What's recursion?**
According to Wikipedia "recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem".

Recursion is basically when a function calls it self until the exit condition is reached. *One of the most important thing is to have the correct exit condition*

**Code**
In the code you can find two uses of recursion, the Fibonacci Sequence and a clean QuickSort.

***Obs.: Python3 is necessary due to one line `for array` (lines 16, 35 & 37)and `f` text formating (lines 41, 43 & 44)
